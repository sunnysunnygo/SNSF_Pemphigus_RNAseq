## Transcriptutorial

This is a tutorial to guide the analysis of RNAseq datasets using footprint based tools such as DOROTHEA, PROGENY and CARNIVAL.

For details instructions to setup the transcriptutorial (data, software, R packages, etc), visit INSTALL.md.

This tutorial is split into several sections, from normalisation to causal network analysis. Once set up, you may run each step sequentially. The corresponding R markdown scripts for each of those sections can be found in the scripts subfolder.

1. [Normalisation](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/01_normalisation.html)

2. [Differential analysis](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/02_differential_analysis.html)

3. [Pathway activity with Progeny](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/03_Pathway_activity_with_Progeny.html)

4. [Trascription factors activity with Dorothea/Viper](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/04_TranscriptionFactor_activity_with_Dorothea.html)

5. [Network reconstruction with CARNIVAL](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/05_network_reconstruction_with_CARNIVAL.html)

6. [Analysis of CARNIVAL results](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/06_analysis_CARNIVAL_results.html)
