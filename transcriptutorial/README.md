# transcriptutorial
This is a tutorial to guide the analysis of RNAseq datasets using footprint based tools such as DOROTHEA, PROGENY and CARNIVAL.

For details instructions to setup the transcriptutorial (data, software, R packages, etc), visit [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

This tutorial is split into several sections, from normalisation to causal network analysis. Once set up, you may run each step sequentially. The corresponding R markdown scripts for each of those sections can be found in the scripts subfolder.
